You've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make the project your own, here are some ideas:

    Add a scoring system
    Implement multiple lives and respawning
    Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
    Add acceleration to the player movement
    Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
    Add a background image
    Create different weapon types
    Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
    Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
    Add a shield power-up
    Add a speed power-up
    Add bombs that can be dropped

Have fun with it, and make sure to share any improvements you make with us in the Discord community!
